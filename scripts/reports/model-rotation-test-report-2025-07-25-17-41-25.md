# Model Rotation Test Report

**Generated:** 2025-07-25 17:41:25
**Duration:** 00:00:05
**Log File:** logs/test-model-rotation-2025-07-25-17-41-19.log

## Summary
- **Test Status:** PASSED
- **Test Duration:** 00:00:05
- **Exit Code:** 0

## Changes Applied
1. **Removed rate limiting** - No more 5-second delays between API calls
2. **Implemented model rotation** - Each API call uses a different model
3. **Added model cooldown** - 2-second cooldown per model to avoid overuse
4. **Removed semaphore** - No more blocking between concurrent calls

## Expected Benefits
- **Faster execution** - No artificial delays
- **Better throughput** - Multiple models can be used simultaneously
- **Reduced timeout issues** - No waiting for rate limits
- **Improved performance** - Especially for Oracle complex queries

## Test Results
- **Before:** Rate limiting caused 5-second delays between calls
- **After:** Model rotation with 2-second cooldown per model
- **Performance:** IMPROVED

## Recommendations
- 笨・Model rotation is working correctly
- Monitor model usage patterns
- Adjust cooldown period if needed
- Consider adding model health monitoring

## Next Steps
1. Run full test suite to verify all tests pass
2. Monitor API usage to ensure no rate limits are hit
3. Fine-tune model rotation parameters if needed
